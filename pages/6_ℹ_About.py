        ### What is SmartStock?

        SmartStock is an SME-focused demand forecasting and
        inventory decision-support application.

        The system analyses historical FMCG sales data,
        identifies demand patterns and uses a trained
        Gradient Boosting machine-learning model to estimate
        future product demand.

        The important distinction is that SmartStock is not
        designed to stop at prediction.

        The forecast is connected to inventory planning so
        that a business can consider current stock, supplier
        lead time and safety-stock requirements before making
        a replenishment decision.

        The application therefore follows a practical
        business chain:

        **Historical Sales → Demand Forecast → Stock Planning
        → Replenishment Decision**

            It is the starting point for the user.

            ---

            ### 📊 Dashboard

            The Dashboard focuses on historical sales analysis.

            Users can filter products and dates and examine:

            - Sales records
            - Total demand
            - Average demand
            - Product performance
            - Demand trends
            - Monthly demand patterns
            - Filtered sales records

            The Dashboard answers:

            **"What has happened in the business?"**

            ---

            ### 📈 Demand Forecast

            The Demand Forecast page uses the production
            Gradient Boosting model to estimate future demand
            for a selected product.

            Users can define:

            - Product
            - Forecast horizon
            - Promotion assumption
            - Discount percentage
            - Rainfall assumption

            The page then produces daily forecast values and
            compares historical demand with expected future
            demand.

            This page answers:

            **"What might happen next?"**

            ---

            ### 📦 Stock Recommendation

            The Stock Recommendation page converts forecast
            demand into inventory planning information.

            Users provide:

            - Current stock
            - Forecast horizon
            - Supplier lead time
            - Safety-stock coverage
            - Promotion assumptions
            - Discount assumptions
            - Rainfall assumptions

            The system calculates:

            - Lead-time demand
            - Safety stock
            - Required stock
            - Recommended reorder quantity
            - Stock status

            This page answers:

            **"What should the business do about its stock?"**

            ---

            ### 📊 Model Performance

            The Model Performance page presents the official
            evaluation results of the production model.

            It is intended to provide transparency around
            model quality and evaluation.

            ---

            The About page explains the entire SmartStock
